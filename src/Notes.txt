/*
FIXED: Fix weird bug where x and o get switched (wasn't weird bug, I just didn't switch to x after winning)
FIXED: reset board after a game
FIXED: Add running score to element on front end, only use pop ups for end of game
FIXED: Two GUIs are made each time the program runs!!
FIXED: Add hover of X for buttons
TODO: fix new match button, check out stack overflow post
TODO: Flush out menu for settings (grid size, colors?, single/double player?), new game, and stop playing
TODO: Clean up Code
FIXED: Show countdown until game restarts
FIXED: Change stop playing button to menu item that automatically closes window

TODO: [low priority] add functionality to support 4x4, 5x5, etc. grids and logic
        (gridSize can be changed in settings, need it to change backend - largest problems)
MAYBE: Title screen (place to go after clicking no, or just quit?)


How to win: start with bottom center or right center, then put a corner, then block diagonal

Clean it up too...
